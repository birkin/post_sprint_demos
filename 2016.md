### usep web

- background: met with E.M., J.R., & B.C. to discuss ways of improving/streamlining interactions with her crew and we programmers.
    - Outcomes:
        - E.M. will work up _rough_ one-pager type document for each project's aims for the coming semester or summer
        - E.M. will touch base with target programmer at the end of a sprint to give a sense of her upcoming goals for the next sprint; then she & programmer and programmer's supervisor can see what might get into the upcoming sprint.
        - One main issue is getting students up-to-speed; for that...
            - at the beginning of a semester/summer, new students will meet with relevant programmer to get working environment set up.
            - discussion about full vagrant/virtualbox install vs lighter-weight virtual-environment
            - BJD would work with E.M.'s current student to get a working environment set up given recent changes in the usep project.

- goal: get student working environment set up

- result:
    - step-by-step [readme write-up](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/usepweb_project/tree/d7f072570cdf462db6d9e900c9aab38a9d630c6a#student-developer-installation) of pieces, and [gotchas](https://github.com/birkin/dev_meetings/blob/16e0de9c9b96aad4cc4f8607e7f6d05defa32c28/2016-07.md#virtualenv-student-environment-work)
    - student working environment successfully set up

- todos:
    - optimize virtualenv approach via shell-script

### software tracker

- background: Overloaded django "projects" project had 3 unrelated apps: usep, rome, and software-tracker. The usep app was moved into it's own project recently, leaving the software-tracker to be extracted so that B.C. could much more easily maintain the rome app.

- goal: get the software tracker app into its own project

- result:
    - updated to a fully modern version of the [code](https://github.com/birkin/software_tracker_project), which drives the software tracker [page](https://library.brown.edu/projects/software/apps/)
    - added one entry (personal goal: to add/edit one entry per sprint)

- todos:
    - move to lib github account
    - simplify authNZ
    - update content
    - consider how to have it help trigger checklist items for completing a project, per discussion w/J.R.

### newtitles

- background: [public page](http://library.brown.edu/titles/) displayed titles, but latest entries were dated 2015

- goal: update content, and automate/re-automate the flow

- result:
    - moved project to [github](https://github.com/birkin/kochief_titles_project) from svn, updating only as necessary
    - settings updated to single shell-script
    - moved apache-python handoff to passenger

- also:
    - K.H. asked for data-access, so enabled an old [solr-public-proxy project](http://library.brown.edu/search/solr_pub/newtitles/?rows=20&start=0&wt=json&indent=on&qt=dismax&sort=accession_date+desc&q.alt=*:*&fq=discipline_facet:%22Music%22&fq=-genre_facet:%22Sound%20recordings%22) to access the new-titles solr index
    - updated the project's [README](https://github.com/birkin/kochief_titles_project/tree/338309a5e767f9e1c2cf2d7eb710725f5f582a5b#solr-queries) with sample requests.
    - didn't quite meet needs, but hopefully useful.

- todos:
    - update django
    - update unicode-handling
    - more broadly, merge flow better with traject parsing, and indexing flows (ideally right into main new-josiah index)

---


### other

- iip 'api'
    - E.M.s iip-prof has had _lots_ of requests for api-access to the data. So, while in the solr-public-proxy, enabled solr-query access for iip.
    - [example query](http://library.brown.edu/search/solr_pub/iip/?start=0&rows=100&indent=on&wt=json&q=*) -- don't worry if a lot of it is greek to you.  ;)

- proxy todos:
    - the proxy app should be its own project -- the project its in is a kochief-based project -- but the proxy app doesn't use that at all -- & it would be easier to maintain, i.e. newer version of django
    - B.C. has done a lot of work on the main bdr proxy -- I should review that for security enhancements
